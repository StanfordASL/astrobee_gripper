SendCommand() in perching_arm.h can only send a 16-bit integer; three commands defined for the Astrobee require a 32-bit signal. However, on the PAC, the uart2_write_register() function can sent in32_t values. 
What is the best way to resolve this discrepancy?

Is pac_pindefs required for any of the files?
